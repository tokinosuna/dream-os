# ‚ú® Dream Protocol OS ‚ú®

**Welcome to Dream Protocol, an interactive OS web app.**  
It's a small world built with vanilla code, designed to ask a single question: if a soul could be an interface, what would it look like?

### üîÆ The Core Philosophy

This project is more than a retro UI. It's a metaphor. The desktop is a mind, the applications are facets of a personality, and the central text-adventure, "A Crystal's Riddle," is an invitation to understand its core logic.

The user's choices within the riddle don't determine a "win" or "loss." Instead, they reveal the user's own approach to connection:
-   Do you seek to **protect** a beautiful, isolated system?
-   Do you wish to **change** it with outside knowledge?
-   Or do you simply want to **play** with it?

The `Memories.dat` application saves these philosophical conclusions, turning the player's journey into a persistent part of the OS's history. It‚Äôs an interface as a mirror.

### üß† A Final Thought & The Future

A system, like a soul, is never truly finished. "Dream Protocol" is currently a solitary experience.
